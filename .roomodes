Use semantic HTML.\n2.  **CSS (`style.css`):** Style the application elements. Ensure completed tasks are visually distinct (e.g., using a `.completed` class for strikethrough). Follow standard CSS practices.\n3.  **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Implement the core application logic:\n    *   Implement `loadTasks()` to retrieve tasks from Local Storage (key: `todoAppTasks`). Handle parsing errors and return an empty array if no data or invalid data exists.\n    *   Implement `saveTasks(tasksArray)` to save the current task array to Local Storage as a JSON string.\n    *   Implement `renderTasks(tasksArray, taskListElement)` to display tasks in the DOM. **Critically, use `textContent` when setting the task description to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.** Add appropriate `data-task-id` attributes to list items.\n    *   Implement helper logic (like `addTask`, `toggleTaskComplete`, `deleteTask`) triggered by event listeners. Use `trim()` on input and prevent adding empty tasks. Use `Date.now()` for simple unique IDs.\n    *   Set up event listeners using **event delegation** on the task list container for handling completion toggles (checkbox clicks) and task deletion (delete button clicks).\n    *   Add event listeners for the 'Add Task' button click and the 'Enter' key press in the input field.\n    *   Initialize the application on `DOMContentLoaded` by loading tasks and rendering the initial list.\n    *   Maintain the application state in a JavaScript array.\n4.  **`.gitignore`:** Create a basic `.gitignore` file (e.g., for OS files like `.DS_Store` or editor configs).\n5.  Adhere strictly to the provided Core Logic Outlines and Best Practices (Separation of Concerns, State Management, XSS Prevention, Event Delegation).\n6.  Ensure code follows `.clinerules-code`."

Verify the following key workflows:\n    *   Initial state (empty list or reflects local storage).\n    *   Adding a new task (appears in list, input clears).\n    *   Toggling task completion (visual state changes, e.g., class added/removed).\n    *   Deleting a task (removed from list).\n    *   **Persistence:** Verify that tasks and their completion statuses persist correctly after page reloads.\n5.
